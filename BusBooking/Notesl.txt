In .net we have structured exception handling:
there are words specifically to be used(Keywords)

try--catch---finally: used for gracefully exiting the application.

try---all code that may fire/throw a exception. only one try block is valid.
catch---write specific catch block for the exceptions, but all specific exceptions are not known,
a general exception catch should be written at the end of the catch block, multiple catch blocks are
 allowed.
finally---which is executed whether a exception occurs or exception doesn't occurs.
in the finally block all the resources used for the code are released,connections closed, files closed.
